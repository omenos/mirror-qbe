There is an experimental amd64_win (native Windows ABI and calling
convention).

In tree, this is currently only tested via cross-compilation from a
Linux host, and using wine to run the tests.

You'll need something like:

	sudo apt install mingw64-w64 dos2unix wine

and then

	make check-amd64_win

should pass.
